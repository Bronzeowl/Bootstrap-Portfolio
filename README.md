# bootstrap-portfolio

This is the second assignment completed for the Houston Coding Bootcamp Delivered by UT Austin.

HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap Framework

In this assignment, we were required to create two different portfolios. The first was an update of the first assignment â€”it was enhanced with a mobile-responsive layout. For the second portfolio, we were required to build a layout with the Bootstrap CSS framework.
